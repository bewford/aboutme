<h1> 
who am i? 
</h1>
<p style="font-family:courier;">I am a 18 year old college student who likes to play around with computers and explore online privacy.</p> 
<h3>
why even make this?
</h3>
<p style="font-family:courier;">This website will be a dump for all my projects i have competed and which ones are a work in progress <i> (maybe future projects too) </i> this website will also serve as a means of promoting myself and what i am able to do.</p> 
<br>
<p style="font-family:courier;">at the moment of making this website <i> may 27 2024 </i> i am learning how to make a website with html <i>(this one)</i></p> 
<h3> Random yapping </h3>
<p style="font-family:courier;">I do not use windows as my main operating system, currently i am using ubuntu as my main operating system. This is for a few reasons; the main reason being that my pc does not support windows 11. This is a blessing as <i> in my opinion </i> windows is spyware. Or at a minimum not privacy respecting at all.</p> 
<br>
<h3> what projects am i planning to do in the future? </h3>
<p style="font-family:courier;">my next goal will be to learn CSS to make my projects look more visually appealing. </p> 
<br>
  <h3>Projects done/wip</h3>
  <p style="font-family:courier;">My most recent project <i>(still a work in progress)</i> is a website i have made of links that are useful to me.</p3>
